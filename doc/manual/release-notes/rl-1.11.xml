features:</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>The Nix language now supports floating point numbers. They are
    based on regular C++ <literal>float</literal> and compatible with
    existing integers and number-related operations. Export and import to and
    from JSON and XML works, too.
  </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>All "chroot"-containing strings got renamed to "sandbox".
      In particular, some nix options got renamed, but the old names
